To Code:
- Paper
- Pen
- Line

Roughly:
dbn.js (tentative name) will accept two parameters
* an element id for the canvas (see what processing.js does)
* the script, either via text or via an html element that contains the script

dbn will create a 100x100, default sketch

call, perhaps, like this
$("#elt").dbn("Paper 50")
or like this
$("#elt").dbn($("textarea").text())
